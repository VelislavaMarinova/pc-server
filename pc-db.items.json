  "description": "In this indulgent side dish, vegetables are layered up with a creamy sauce, caramelised onions, and flavours of nutmeg, garlic and thyme",
  "ingredients": [
    "50g butter, plus extra for greasing",
    "2 large onions, halved and thinly sliced",
    "1 tsp golden caster sugar",
    "500ml milk",
    "good grating of nutmeg",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "5 thyme sprigs, chopped",
    "300ml pot double cream",

  "method": [
    "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and grease a shallow ovenproof dish about 35 x 24cm. Melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan, add the onions and fry for 10 mins, stirring frequently, until soft and starting to turn golden. Sprinkle over some seasoning and the sugar, stir again, then cook 5-10 mins more until golden. Meanwhile, heat the milk with the nutmeg, garlic, thyme and seasoning. When the mixture starts to boil, pour in the cream and turn off the heat.",
    "Quarter the celeriac and thinly slice, then arrange in the base of the dish. Pour over half the milk mixture, then spoon over the golden onions. Thinly slice the ends of the potatoes, reserving the middles. Pile the sliced potatoes into the dish, then thinly slice the reserved middle sections and arrange neatly on top. (By cutting the potatoes this way, you should have neat slices roughly all the same size for the top of the gratin.) Pour over the remaining milk mixture, scatter over the Parmesan and bake for 1 hr 30 mins until a knife easily cuts through the layers. Allow to rest for 10 mins before serving to allow the creamy sauce to soak into the potatoes."

    "Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan, and use a little more to grease a 900g loaf tin. Put the onion in the pan and cook gently for 10-15 mins until caramelised.

    "Stretch each piece of bacon a little with the back of your knife. Arrange the rashers so the base of the tin is covered with overlapping bacon and the rashers come neatly up the sides in a single layer, overhanging generously. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top of the bacon.",

    "Cut each turkey breast steak into three strips. Layer roughly half the turkey on top of the stuffing mix, filling any gaps like a jigsaw, but keeping the turkey in one thick layer, then season. Spread over a little more cranberry sauce, then top with the remaining stuffing, cranberry sauce and turkey in the same way, making sure there are no gaps between the layers. The parcel should be full to the top when you’re finished. Fold over the overhanging bacon and wrap the tin in foil. Can now be chilled for up to 2 days.",
    "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the tin on a baking tray and cook for 1 hr 30 mins. Remove the tin from the oven and leave to cool for 10 mins. Carefully lift the parcel out of the tin, using the foil handles. Roll the parcel over onto a baking tray. Return to the oven for a further 15-20 mins until the outside is crisp and browning. Test the internal temperature with a thermometer, if you have one – it should read 75C when it’s ready. Or insert a metal skewer into the centre of the parcel and check it is piping hot. Cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for at least 15 mins before serving. Top with the reserved sage leaves, then slice. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 2 days."
